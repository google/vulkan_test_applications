# Multiplanar Image Explicit

This sample renders a rotating cube with a multiplanar texture that is
explicitly reconstructed with a VkSamplerYcbcrConversion. The sampler Yâ€™CBCR
conversion feature is enabled by requesting the
`VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2` instance extension and the device
extensions `VK_KHR_maintenance1`, `VK_KHR_get_memory_requirements2`, and
`VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion`. Explicit reconstruction is controlled by the
forceExplicitReconstruction flag in `VkSamplerYcbcrConversionCreateInfo`.
