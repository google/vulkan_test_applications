# BUILD_APKS invokes all of the build in a special mode.
# Instead of actually creating libraries and executables, we generate Android Studio
# projects that depend on all of the libraries and executables. When we go and actually
# run ninja, we invoke gradle on any out of date projects.
# This means that there are 3 main modes that this build may be run in.
# 1) A normal cmake build. This builds targets for the host platform.
# 2a) A build with BUILD_APKS which will not itself create any libraries or executables, but
#      will create Android Studio projects to do the same. A build will
#      then run gradle on those projects which will run 2b) below.
# 2b) A build FROM Android Studio, this will set(ANDROID TRUE),
#      and generate shared libraries for use in an APK.
